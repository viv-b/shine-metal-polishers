            <div class="editable"><h2>FAQ's</h2><p><strong>Can you get pin holes out of jobs?</strong><br />Some we can but if too deep all we can do is offer our best to minimise the defect.</p><p><strong>Can you remove corrosion on diecast?</strong><br />Corrosion on diecast eats away at the metal so can not remove all. Also Diecast will blister when plated.</p><p><strong>Can you panel beat &amp; do minor repairs?</strong><br />We can remove some minor dents and do some minor repair work as we have a gas set. Major dents will have to be taken by you to a Panel Beater of your choice.</p><p><strong>Can you offer a Chrome Plating Service?</strong><br />Not on our premises as we strictly do polishing. We can direct you to Otahuhu Chrome for your plating requirements. Andy Stewart has years of experience to complete that service for you. We will have the polishing done ready for that step.</p><p><strong>Do you polish where you can&rsquo;t see?</strong><br />To enable us to keep our prices down there is no point in doing that. Because we have the experience with vehicles on show we know what is important to polish.</p><p><strong>Can you offer a baked on Lacquer Service?</strong><br />We don&rsquo;t do it here but will direct you to someone that can.</p><p><strong>Do you do repetition work?</strong><br />Yes we do. We need to view the job and we will quote for that work.</p></div>
